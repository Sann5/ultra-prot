# ðŸš€ Ultra-high Sensitivity Mass Spectrometry Single-Cell Proteome Analysis

This repository contains a reproduction of the analysis made in [Ultra-high sensitivity mass spectrometry quantifies single-cell proteome changes upon perturbation](https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.202110798), A Brunner, ..., M Mann, Molecular Systems Biology (2022), specifically the ones contained in the ascoiated [repo](https://github.com/theislab/singlecell_proteomics). The reproduction restructures the analysis with [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a workflow management system that benefits from improved readability, portability, modularization, transparency, scalability.

## Usage

### Create an Environment

Using a virtual environment is strongly recommended. If you use [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for example you can create an environment with the following command.

```sh
mamba env create --name <choose_a_name> --file environment.yaml
```
